To build a jar using [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), press the code button and click "Download ZIP" on the github repository containing the source code. Now, extract the zip file and open Intellij. Click the open button and select the folder you extracted.

After you have created the workspace, open the Gradle tab on the right hand side and click on Tasks -> build -> build. After the jar has finished building, it will be stored in build -> libs in the main folder. Sometimes, there may be multiple files. Ignore ones that end in -sources or -dev as you can't use these as mods. Now, you can drag the main .jar into your mods folder.

DO NOT FUCKING ASK ME TO HELP WITH BUILDING WITHOUT INTELLIJ
