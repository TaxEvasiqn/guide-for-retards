First, to bypass anti-xray, you will need the seed of the server you plan to xray on. To do this, you need [SeedCrackerX](https://github.com/19MisterX98/SeedcrackerX).

After you have installed seed cracker, join the server and type ".server" assuming you have [Meteor Client](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client) installed. Then, check the server version. Sometimes the version will read 1.7-1.18 or something similar because ViaVersion is installed. Usually, the server's actual version will be stated somewhere obvious, for example in the motd or scoreboard. Alternatively, you can use freecam to go to Y 0 and see if it stops at bedrock to determine whether it's 1.18 or under.

Now that you have the version, type "/seed gui" and select the correct version (if the server is 1.18.2 or 1.19 choose the newest option as the generation hasn't really changed). If the server is 1.18 or above, make sure that only some of the options are selected, usually default. If it's under 1.18, turn everything on. Now, you just need to walk around and find structures to crack the seed, which will be printed in the chat after it is found.

After getting the seed, make sure you have [Meteor Rejects](https://github.com/anticope/meteor-rejects) installed and type ".seed the_seed server_version" in chat. The server version is actually redundant, only to help you remember the version. Now, use the Ore Sim module in Rejects, and choose the correct server version. Sometimes, the ores shown will be buggy near bedrock and the surface as the world generation overwrites ores (probably something like that) and will highlight ores where there is bedrock/stone.
